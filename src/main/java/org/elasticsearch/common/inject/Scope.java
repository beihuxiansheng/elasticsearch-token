comment|/**  * A scope is a level of visibility that instances provided by Guice may have.  * By default, an instance created by the {@link Injector} has<i>no scope</i>,  * meaning it has no state from the framework's perspective -- the  * {@code Injector} creates it, injects it once into the class that required it,  * and then immediately forgets it. Associating a scope with a particular  * binding allows the created instance to be "remembered" and possibly used  * again for other injections.  *<p/>  *<p>An example of a scope is {@link Scopes#SINGLETON}.  *  * @author crazybob@google.com (Bob Lee)  */
