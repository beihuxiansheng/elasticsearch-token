Of necessity this means that  * all public fields are final, and that all public final reference fields refer  * to other immutable objects, and that methods do not publish references to any  * internal state which is mutable by implementation even if not by design.  * Immutable objects may still have internal mutable state for purposes of  * performance optimization; some state variables may be lazily computed, so  * long as they are computed from immutable state and that callers cannot tell  * the difference.  *<p/>  * Immutable objects are inherently thread-safe; they may be passed between  * threads or published without synchronization.  *  *  */
