comment|/**  * Abstract base class for tasks that run within a {@link ForkJoinPool}.  * A {@code ForkJoinTask} is a thread-like entity that is much  * lighter weight than a normal thread.  Huge numbers of tasks and  * subtasks may be hosted by a small number of actual threads in a  * ForkJoinPool, at the price of some usage limitations.  *  *<p>A "main" {@code ForkJoinTask} begins execution when it is  * explicitly submitted to a {@link ForkJoinPool}, or, if not already  * engaged in a ForkJoin computation, commenced in the {@link  * ForkJoinPool#commonPool()} via {@link #fork}, {@link #invoke}, or  * related methods.  Once started, it will usually in turn start other  * subtasks.  As indicated by the name of this class, many programs  * using {@code ForkJoinTask} employ only methods {@link #fork} and  * {@link #join}, or derivatives such as {@link  * #invokeAll(ForkJoinTask...) invokeAll}.  However, this class also  * provides a number of other methods that can come into play in  * advanced usages, as well as extension mechanics that allow support  * of new forms of fork/join processing.  *  *<p>A {@code ForkJoinTask} is a lightweight form of {@link Future}.  * The efficiency of {@code ForkJoinTask}s stems from a set of  * restrictions (that are only partially statically enforceable)  * reflecting their main use as computational tasks calculating pure  * functions or operating on purely isolated objects.  The primary  * coordination mechanisms are {@link #fork}, that arranges  * asynchronous execution, and {@link #join}, that doesn't proceed  * until the task's result has been computed.  Computations should  * ideally avoid {@code synchronized} methods or blocks, and should  * minimize other blocking synchronization apart from joining other  * tasks or using synchronizers such as Phasers that are advertised to  * cooperate with fork/join scheduling. Subdividable tasks should also  * not perform blocking I/O, and should ideally access variables that  * are completely independent of those accessed by other running  * tasks. These guidelines are loosely enforced by not permitting  * checked exceptions such as {@code IOExceptions} to be  * thrown. However, computations may still encounter unchecked  * exceptions, that are rethrown to callers attempting to join  * them. These exceptions may additionally include {@link  * RejectedExecutionException} stemming from internal resource  * exhaustion, such as failure to allocate internal task  * queues. Rethrown exceptions behave in the same way as regular  * exceptions, but, when possible, contain stack traces (as displayed  * for example using {@code ex.printStackTrace()}) of both the thread  * that initiated the computation as well as the thread actually  * encountering the exception; minimally only the latter.  *  *<p>It is possible to define and use ForkJoinTasks that may block,  * but doing do requires three further considerations: (1) Completion  * of few if any<em>other</em> tasks should be dependent on a task  * that blocks on external synchronization or I/O. Event-style async  * tasks that are never joined (for example, those subclassing {@link  * CountedCompleter}) often fall into this category.  (2) To minimize  * resource impact, tasks should be small; ideally performing only the  * (possibly) blocking action. (3) Unless the {@link  * ForkJoinPool.ManagedBlocker} API is used, or the number of possibly  * blocked tasks is known to be less than the pool's {@link  * ForkJoinPool#getParallelism} level, the pool cannot guarantee that  * enough threads will be available to ensure progress or good  * performance.  *  *<p>The primary method for awaiting completion and extracting  * results of a task is {@link #join}, but there are several variants:  * The {@link Future#get} methods support interruptible and/or timed  * waits for completion and report results using {@code Future}  * conventions. Method {@link #invoke} is semantically  * equivalent to {@code fork(); join()} but always attempts to begin  * execution in the current thread. The "<em>quiet</em>" forms of  * these methods do not extract results or report exceptions. These  * may be useful when a set of tasks are being executed, and you need  * to delay processing of results or exceptions until all complete.  * Method {@code invokeAll} (available in multiple versions)  * performs the most common form of parallel invocation: forking a set  * of tasks and joining them all.  *  *<p>In the most typical usages, a fork-join pair act like a call  * (fork) and return (join) from a parallel recursive function. As is  * the case with other forms of recursive calls, returns (joins)  * should be performed innermost-first. For example, {@code a.fork();  * b.fork(); b.join(); a.join();} is likely to be substantially more  * efficient than joining {@code a} before {@code b}.  *  *<p>The execution status of tasks may be queried at several levels  * of detail: {@link #isDone} is true if a task completed in any way  * (including the case where a task was cancelled without executing);  * {@link #isCompletedNormally} is true if a task completed without  * cancellation or encountering an exception; {@link #isCancelled} is  * true if the task was cancelled (in which case {@link #getException}  * returns a {@link java.util.concurrent.CancellationException}); and  * {@link #isCompletedAbnormally} is true if a task was either  * cancelled or encountered an exception, in which case {@link  * #getException} will return either the encountered exception or  * {@link java.util.concurrent.CancellationException}.  *  *<p>The ForkJoinTask class is not usually directly subclassed.  * Instead, you subclass one of the abstract classes that support a  * particular style of fork/join processing, typically {@link  * RecursiveAction} for most computations that do not return results,  * {@link RecursiveTask} for those that do, and {@link  * CountedCompleter} for those in which completed actions trigger  * other actions.  Normally, a concrete ForkJoinTask subclass declares  * fields comprising its parameters, established in a constructor, and  * then defines a {@code compute} method that somehow uses the control  * methods supplied by this base class.  *  *<p>Method {@link #join} and its variants are appropriate for use  * only when completion dependencies are acyclic; that is, the  * parallel computation can be described as a directed acyclic graph  * (DAG). Otherwise, executions may encounter a form of deadlock as  * tasks cyclically wait for each other.  However, this framework  * supports other methods and techniques (for example the use of  * {@link java.util.concurrent.Phaser}, {@link #helpQuiesce}, and  * {@link #complete}) that  * may be of use in constructing custom subclasses for problems that  * are not statically structured as DAGs. To support such usages a  * ForkJoinTask may be atomically<em>tagged</em> with a {@code short}  * value using {@link #setForkJoinTaskTag} or {@link  * #compareAndSetForkJoinTaskTag} and checked using {@link  * #getForkJoinTaskTag}. The ForkJoinTask implementation does not use  * these {@code protected} methods or tags for any purpose, but they  * may be of use in the construction of specialized subclasses.  For  * example, parallel graph traversals can use the supplied methods to  * avoid revisiting nodes/tasks that have already been processed.  * (Method names for tagging are bulky in part to encourage definition  * of methods that reflect their usage patterns.)  *  *<p>Most base support methods are {@code final}, to prevent  * overriding of implementations that are intrinsically tied to the  * underlying lightweight task scheduling framework.  Developers  * creating new basic styles of fork/join processing should minimally  * implement {@code protected} methods {@link #exec}, {@link  * #setRawResult}, and {@link #getRawResult}, while also introducing  * an abstract computational method that can be implemented in its  * subclasses, possibly relying on other {@code protected} methods  * provided by this class.  *  *<p>ForkJoinTasks should perform relatively small amounts of  * computation. Large tasks should be split into smaller subtasks,  * usually via recursive decomposition. As a very rough rule of thumb,  * a task should perform more than 100 and less than 10000 basic  * computational steps, and should avoid indefinite looping. If tasks  * are too big, then parallelism cannot improve throughput. If too  * small, then memory and internal task maintenance overhead may  * overwhelm processing.  *  *<p>This class provides {@code adapt} methods for {@link Runnable}  * and {@link Callable}, that may be of use when mixing execution of  * {@code ForkJoinTasks} with other kinds of tasks. When all tasks are  * of this form, consider using a pool constructed in<em>asyncMode</em>.  *  *<p>ForkJoinTasks are {@code Serializable}, which enables them to be  * used in extensions such as remote execution frameworks. It is  * sensible to serialize tasks only before or after, but not during,  * execution. Serialization is not relied on during execution itself.  *  * @since 1.7  * @author Doug Lea  */

comment|/*      * The status field holds run control status bits packed into a      * single int to minimize footprint and to ensure atomicity (via      * CAS).  Status is initially zero, and takes on nonnegative      * values until completed, upon which status (anded with      * DONE_MASK) holds value NORMAL, CANCELLED, or EXCEPTIONAL. Tasks      * undergoing blocking waits by other threads have the SIGNAL bit      * set.  Completion of a stolen task with SIGNAL set awakens any      * waiters via notifyAll. Even though suboptimal for some      * purposes, we use basic builtin wait/notify to take advantage of      * "monitor inflation" in JVMs that we would otherwise need to      * emulate to avoid adding further per-task bookkeeping overhead.      * We want these monitors to be "fat", i.e., not use biasing or      * thin-lock techniques, so use some odd coding idioms that tend      * to avoid them, mainly by arranging that every synchronized      * block performs a wait, notifyAll or both.      *      * These control bits occupy only (some of) the upper half (16      * bits) of status field. The lower bits are used for user-defined      * tags.      */
