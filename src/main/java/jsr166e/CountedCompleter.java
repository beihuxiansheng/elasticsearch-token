comment|/**  * A {@link ForkJoinTask} with a completion action performed when  * triggered and there are no remaining pending  * actions. CountedCompleters are in general more robust in the  * presence of subtask stalls and blockage than are other forms of  * ForkJoinTasks, but are less intuitive to program.  Uses of  * CountedCompleter are similar to those of other completion based  * components (such as {@link java.nio.channels.CompletionHandler})  * except that multiple<em>pending</em> completions may be necessary  * to trigger the {@link #onCompletion} action, not just one. Unless  * initialized otherwise, the {@link #getPendingCount pending count}  * starts at zero, but may be (atomically) changed using methods  * {@link #setPendingCount}, {@link #addToPendingCount}, and {@link  * #compareAndSetPendingCount}. Upon invocation of {@link  * #tryComplete}, if the pending action count is nonzero, it is  * decremented; otherwise, the completion action is performed, and if  * this completer itself has a completer, the process is continued  * with its completer.  As is the case with related synchronization  * components such as {@link java.util.concurrent.Phaser Phaser} and  * {@link java.util.concurrent.Semaphore Semaphore}, these methods  * affect only internal counts; they do not establish any further  * internal bookkeeping. In particular, the identities of pending  * tasks are not maintained. As illustrated below, you can create  * subclasses that do record some or all pending tasks or their  * results when needed.  As illustrated below, utility methods  * supporting customization of completion traversals are also  * provided. However, because CountedCompleters provide only basic  * synchronization mechanisms, it may be useful to create further  * abstract subclasses that maintain linkages, fields, and additional  * support methods appropriate for a set of related usages.  *  *<p>A concrete CountedCompleter class must define method {@link  * #compute}, that should in most cases (as illustrated below), invoke  * {@code tryComplete()} once before returning. The class may also  * optionally override method {@link #onCompletion} to perform an  * action upon normal completion, and method {@link  * #onExceptionalCompletion} to perform an action upon any exception.  *  *<p>CountedCompleters most often do not bear results, in which case  * they are normally declared as {@code CountedCompleter<Void>}, and  * will always return {@code null} as a result value.  In other cases,  * you should override method {@link #getRawResult} to provide a  * result from {@code join(), invoke()}, and related methods.  In  * general, this method should return the value of a field (or a  * function of one or more fields) of the CountedCompleter object that  * holds the result upon completion. Method {@link #setRawResult} by  * default plays no role in CountedCompleters.  It is possible, but  * rarely applicable, to override this method to maintain other  * objects or fields holding result data.  *  *<p>A CountedCompleter that does not itself have a completer (i.e.,  * one for which {@link #getCompleter} returns {@code null}) can be  * used as a regular ForkJoinTask with this added functionality.  * However, any completer that in turn has another completer serves  * only as an internal helper for other computations, so its own task  * status (as reported in methods such as {@link ForkJoinTask#isDone})  * is arbitrary; this status changes only upon explicit invocations of  * {@link #complete}, {@link ForkJoinTask#cancel}, {@link  * ForkJoinTask#completeExceptionally} or upon exceptional completion  * of method {@code compute}. Upon any exceptional completion, the  * exception may be relayed to a task's completer (and its completer,  * and so on), if one exists and it has not otherwise already  * completed. Similarly, cancelling an internal CountedCompleter has  * only a local effect on that completer, so is not often useful.  *  *<p><b>Sample Usages.</b>  *  *<p><b>Parallel recursive decomposition.</b> CountedCompleters may  * be arranged in trees similar to those often used with {@link  * RecursiveAction}s, although the constructions involved in setting  * them up typically vary. Here, the completer of each task is its  * parent in the computation tree. Even though they entail a bit more  * bookkeeping, CountedCompleters may be better choices when applying  * a possibly time-consuming operation (that cannot be further  * subdivided) to each element of an array or collection; especially  * when the operation takes a significantly different amount of time  * to complete for some elements than others, either because of  * intrinsic variation (for example I/O) or auxiliary effects such as  * garbage collection.  Because CountedCompleters provide their own  * continuations, other threads need not block waiting to perform  * them.  *  *<p>For example, here is an initial version of a class that uses  * divide-by-two recursive decomposition to divide work into single  * pieces (leaf tasks). Even when work is split into individual calls,  * tree-based techniques are usually preferable to directly forking  * leaf tasks, because they reduce inter-thread communication and  * improve load balancing. In the recursive case, the second of each  * pair of subtasks to finish triggers completion of its parent  * (because no result combination is performed, the default no-op  * implementation of method {@code onCompletion} is not overridden). A  * static utility method sets up the base task and invokes it  * (here, implicitly using the {@link ForkJoinPool#commonPool()}).  *  *<pre> {@code  * class MyOperation<E> { void apply(E e) { ... }  }  *  * class ForEach<E> extends CountedCompleter<Void> {  *  *   public static<E> void forEach(E[] array, MyOperation<E> op) {  *     new ForEach<E>(null, array, op, 0, array.length).invoke();  *   }  *  *   final E[] array; final MyOperation<E> op; final int lo, hi;  *   ForEach(CountedCompleter<?> p, E[] array, MyOperation<E> op, int lo, int hi) {  *     super(p);  *     this.array = array; this.op = op; this.lo = lo; this.hi = hi;  *   }  *  *   public void compute() { // version 1  *     if (hi - lo>= 2) {  *       int mid = (lo + hi)>>> 1;  *       setPendingCount(2); // must set pending count before fork  *       new ForEach(this, array, op, mid, hi).fork(); // right child  *       new ForEach(this, array, op, lo, mid).fork(); // left child  *     }  *     else if (hi> lo)  *       op.apply(array[lo]);  *     tryComplete();  *   }  * }}</pre>  *  * This design can be improved by noticing that in the recursive case,  * the task has nothing to do after forking its right task, so can  * directly invoke its left task before returning. (This is an analog  * of tail recursion removal.)  Also, because the task returns upon  * executing its left task (rather than falling through to invoke  * {@code tryComplete}) the pending count is set to one:  *  *<pre> {@code  * class ForEach<E> ...  *   public void compute() { // version 2  *     if (hi - lo>= 2) {  *       int mid = (lo + hi)>>> 1;  *       setPendingCount(1); // only one pending  *       new ForEach(this, array, op, mid, hi).fork(); // right child  *       new ForEach(this, array, op, lo, mid).compute(); // direct invoke  *     }  *     else {  *       if (hi> lo)  *         op.apply(array[lo]);  *       tryComplete();  *     }  *   }  * }</pre>  *  * As a further improvement, notice that the left task need not even  * exist.  Instead of creating a new one, we can iterate using the  * original task, and add a pending count for each fork. Additionally,  * because no task in this tree implements an {@link #onCompletion}  * method, {@code tryComplete()} can be replaced with {@link  * #propagateCompletion}.  *  *<pre> {@code  * class ForEach<E> ...  *   public void compute() { // version 3  *     int l = lo,  h = hi;  *     while (h - l>= 2) {  *       int mid = (l + h)>>> 1;  *       addToPendingCount(1);  *       new ForEach(this, array, op, mid, h).fork(); // right child  *       h = mid;  *     }  *     if (h> l)  *       op.apply(array[l]);  *     propagateCompletion();  *   }  * }</pre>  *  * Additional improvements of such classes might entail precomputing  * pending counts so that they can be established in constructors,  * specializing classes for leaf steps, subdividing by say, four,  * instead of two per iteration, and using an adaptive threshold  * instead of always subdividing down to single elements.  *  *<p><b>Searching.</b> A tree of CountedCompleters can search for a  * value or property in different parts of a data structure, and  * report a result in an {@link  * java.util.concurrent.atomic.AtomicReference AtomicReference} as  * soon as one is found. The others can poll the result to avoid  * unnecessary work. (You could additionally {@linkplain #cancel  * cancel} other tasks, but it is usually simpler and more efficient  * to just let them notice that the result is set and if so skip  * further processing.)  Illustrating again with an array using full  * partitioning (again, in practice, leaf tasks will almost always  * process more than one element):  *  *<pre> {@code  * class Searcher<E> extends CountedCompleter<E> {  *   final E[] array; final AtomicReference<E> result; final int lo, hi;  *   Searcher(CountedCompleter<?> p, E[] array, AtomicReference<E> result, int lo, int hi) {  *     super(p);  *     this.array = array; this.result = result; this.lo = lo; this.hi = hi;  *   }  *   public E getRawResult() { return result.get(); }  *   public void compute() { // similar to ForEach version 3  *     int l = lo,  h = hi;  *     while (result.get() == null&& h>= l) {  *       if (h - l>= 2) {  *         int mid = (l + h)>>> 1;  *         addToPendingCount(1);  *         new Searcher(this, array, result, mid, h).fork();  *         h = mid;  *       }  *       else {  *         E x = array[l];  *         if (matches(x)&& result.compareAndSet(null, x))  *           quietlyCompleteRoot(); // root task is now joinable  *         break;  *       }  *     }  *     tryComplete(); // normally complete whether or not found  *   }  *   boolean matches(E e) { ... } // return true if found  *  *   public static<E> E search(E[] array) {  *       return new Searcher<E>(null, array, new AtomicReference<E>(), 0, array.length).invoke();  *   }  * }}</pre>  *  * In this example, as well as others in which tasks have no other  * effects except to compareAndSet a common result, the trailing  * unconditional invocation of {@code tryComplete} could be made  * conditional ({@code if (result.get() == null) tryComplete();})  * because no further bookkeeping is required to manage completions  * once the root task completes.  *  *<p><b>Recording subtasks.</b> CountedCompleter tasks that combine  * results of multiple subtasks usually need to access these results  * in method {@link #onCompletion}. As illustrated in the following  * class (that performs a simplified form of map-reduce where mappings  * and reductions are all of type {@code E}), one way to do this in  * divide and conquer designs is to have each subtask record its  * sibling, so that it can be accessed in method {@code onCompletion}.  * This technique applies to reductions in which the order of  * combining left and right results does not matter; ordered  * reductions require explicit left/right designations.  Variants of  * other streamlinings seen in the above examples may also apply.  *  *<pre> {@code  * class MyMapper<E> { E apply(E v) {  ...  } }  * class MyReducer<E> { E apply(E x, E y) {  ...  } }  * class MapReducer<E> extends CountedCompleter<E> {  *   final E[] array; final MyMapper<E> mapper;  *   final MyReducer<E> reducer; final int lo, hi;  *   MapReducer<E> sibling;  *   E result;  *   MapReducer(CountedCompleter<?> p, E[] array, MyMapper<E> mapper,  *              MyReducer<E> reducer, int lo, int hi) {  *     super(p);  *     this.array = array; this.mapper = mapper;  *     this.reducer = reducer; this.lo = lo; this.hi = hi;  *   }  *   public void compute() {  *     if (hi - lo>= 2) {  *       int mid = (lo + hi)>>> 1;  *       MapReducer<E> left = new MapReducer(this, array, mapper, reducer, lo, mid);  *       MapReducer<E> right = new MapReducer(this, array, mapper, reducer, mid, hi);  *       left.sibling = right;  *       right.sibling = left;  *       setPendingCount(1); // only right is pending  *       right.fork();  *       left.compute();     // directly execute left  *     }  *     else {  *       if (hi> lo)  *           result = mapper.apply(array[lo]);  *       tryComplete();  *     }  *   }  *   public void onCompletion(CountedCompleter<?> caller) {  *     if (caller != this) {  *       MapReducer<E> child = (MapReducer<E>)caller;  *       MapReducer<E> sib = child.sibling;  *       if (sib == null || sib.result == null)  *         result = child.result;  *       else  *         result = reducer.apply(child.result, sib.result);  *     }  *   }  *   public E getRawResult() { return result; }  *  *   public static<E> E mapReduce(E[] array, MyMapper<E> mapper, MyReducer<E> reducer) {  *     return new MapReducer<E>(null, array, mapper, reducer,  *                              0, array.length).invoke();  *   }  * }}</pre>  *  * Here, method {@code onCompletion} takes a form common to many  * completion designs that combine results. This callback-style method  * is triggered once per task, in either of the two different contexts  * in which the pending count is, or becomes, zero: (1) by a task  * itself, if its pending count is zero upon invocation of {@code  * tryComplete}, or (2) by any of its subtasks when they complete and  * decrement the pending count to zero. The {@code caller} argument  * distinguishes cases.  Most often, when the caller is {@code this},  * no action is necessary. Otherwise the caller argument can be used  * (usually via a cast) to supply a value (and/or links to other  * values) to be combined.  Assuming proper use of pending counts, the  * actions inside {@code onCompletion} occur (once) upon completion of  * a task and its subtasks. No additional synchronization is required  * within this method to ensure thread safety of accesses to fields of  * this task or other completed tasks.  *  *<p><b>Completion Traversals</b>. If using {@code onCompletion} to  * process completions is inapplicable or inconvenient, you can use  * methods {@link #firstComplete} and {@link #nextComplete} to create  * custom traversals.  For example, to define a MapReducer that only  * splits out right-hand tasks in the form of the third ForEach  * example, the completions must cooperatively reduce along  * unexhausted subtask links, which can be done as follows:  *  *<pre> {@code  * class MapReducer<E> extends CountedCompleter<E> { // version 2  *   final E[] array; final MyMapper<E> mapper;  *   final MyReducer<E> reducer; final int lo, hi;  *   MapReducer<E> forks, next; // record subtask forks in list  *   E result;  *   MapReducer(CountedCompleter<?> p, E[] array, MyMapper<E> mapper,  *              MyReducer<E> reducer, int lo, int hi, MapReducer<E> next) {  *     super(p);  *     this.array = array; this.mapper = mapper;  *     this.reducer = reducer; this.lo = lo; this.hi = hi;  *     this.next = next;  *   }  *   public void compute() {  *     int l = lo,  h = hi;  *     while (h - l>= 2) {  *       int mid = (l + h)>>> 1;  *       addToPendingCount(1);  *       (forks = new MapReducer(this, array, mapper, reducer, mid, h, forks)).fork;  *       h = mid;  *     }  *     if (h> l)  *       result = mapper.apply(array[l]);  *     // process completions by reducing along and advancing subtask links  *     for (CountedCompleter<?> c = firstComplete(); c != null; c = c.nextComplete()) {  *       for (MapReducer t = (MapReducer)c, s = t.forks;  s != null; s = t.forks = s.next)  *         t.result = reducer.apply(t.result, s.result);  *     }  *   }  *   public E getRawResult() { return result; }  *  *   public static<E> E mapReduce(E[] array, MyMapper<E> mapper, MyReducer<E> reducer) {  *     return new MapReducer<E>(null, array, mapper, reducer,  *                              0, array.length, null).invoke();  *   }  * }}</pre>  *  *<p><b>Triggers.</b> Some CountedCompleters are themselves never  * forked, but instead serve as bits of plumbing in other designs;  * including those in which the completion of one of more async tasks  * triggers another async task. For example:  *  *<pre> {@code  * class HeaderBuilder extends CountedCompleter<...> { ... }  * class BodyBuilder extends CountedCompleter<...> { ... }  * class PacketSender extends CountedCompleter<...> {  *   PacketSender(...) { super(null, 1); ... } // trigger on second completion  *   public void compute() { } // never called  *   public void onCompletion(CountedCompleter<?> caller) { sendPacket(); }  * }  * // sample use:  * PacketSender p = new PacketSender();  * new HeaderBuilder(p, ...).fork();  * new BodyBuilder(p, ...).fork();  * }</pre>  *  * @since 1.8  * @author Doug Lea  */
