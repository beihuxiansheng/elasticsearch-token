This  * enables efficient processing when most tasks spawn other subtasks  * (as do most {@code ForkJoinTask}s), as well as when many small  * tasks are submitted to the pool from external clients.  Especially  * when setting<em>asyncMode</em> to true in constructors, {@code  * ForkJoinPool}s may also be appropriate for use with event-style  * tasks that are never joined.  *  *<p>A static {@link #commonPool()} is available and appropriate for  * most applications. The common pool is used by any ForkJoinTask that  * is not explicitly submitted to a specified pool. Using the common  * pool normally reduces resource usage (its threads are slowly  * reclaimed during periods of non-use, and reinstated upon subsequent  * use).  *  *<p>For applications that require separate or custom pools, a {@code  * ForkJoinPool} may be constructed with a given target parallelism  * level; by default, equal to the number of available processors. The  * pool attempts to maintain enough active (or available) threads by  * dynamically adding, suspending, or resuming internal worker  * threads, even if some tasks are stalled waiting to join  * others. However, no such adjustments are guaranteed in the face of  * blocked I/O or other unmanaged synchronization. The nested {@link  * ManagedBlocker} interface enables extension of the kinds of  * synchronization accommodated.  *  *<p>In addition to execution and lifecycle control methods, this  * class provides status check methods (for example  * {@link #getStealCount}) that are intended to aid in developing,  * tuning, and monitoring fork/join applications. Also, method  * {@link #toString} returns indications of pool state in a  * convenient form for informal monitoring.  *  *<p>As is the case with other ExecutorServices, there are three  * main task execution methods summarized in the following table.  * These are designed to be used primarily by clients not already  * engaged in fork/join computations in the current pool.  The main  * forms of these methods accept instances of {@code ForkJoinTask},  * but overloaded forms also allow mixed execution of plain {@code  * Runnable}- or {@code Callable}- based activities as well.  However,  * tasks that are already executing in a pool should normally instead  * use the within-computation forms listed in the table unless using  * async event-style tasks that are not usually joined, in which case  * there is little difference among choice of methods.  *  *<table BORDER CELLPADDING=3 CELLSPACING=1>  *<tr>  *<td></td>  *<td ALIGN=CENTER><b>Call from non-fork/join clients</b></td>  *<td ALIGN=CENTER><b>Call from within fork/join computations</b></td>  *</tr>  *<tr>  *<td><b>Arrange async execution</td>  *<td> {@link #execute(ForkJoinTask)}</td>  *<td> {@link ForkJoinTask#fork}</td>  *</tr>  *<tr>  *<td><b>Await and obtain result</td>  *<td> {@link #invoke(ForkJoinTask)}</td>  *<td> {@link ForkJoinTask#invoke}</td>  *</tr>  *<tr>  *<td><b>Arrange exec and obtain Future</td>  *<td> {@link #submit(ForkJoinTask)}</td>  *<td> {@link ForkJoinTask#fork} (ForkJoinTasks<em>are</em> Futures)</td>  *</tr>  *</table>  *  *<p>The common pool is by default constructed with default  * parameters, but these may be controlled by setting three {@link  * System#getProperty system properties} with prefix {@code  * java.util.concurrent.ForkJoinPool.common}: {@code parallelism} --  * an integer greater than zero, {@code threadFactory} -- the class  * name of a {@link ForkJoinWorkerThreadFactory}, and {@code  * exceptionHandler} -- the class name of a {@link  * java.lang.Thread.UncaughtExceptionHandler  * Thread.UncaughtExceptionHandler}. Upon any error in establishing  * these settings, default parameters are used.  *  *<p><b>Implementation notes</b>: This implementation restricts the  * maximum number of running threads to 32767. Attempts to create  * pools with greater than the maximum number result in  * {@code IllegalArgumentException}.  *  *<p>This implementation rejects submitted tasks (that is, by throwing  * {@link RejectedExecutionException}) only when the pool is shut down  * or internal resources have been exhausted.  *  * @since 1.7  * @author Doug Lea  */

comment|/*      * Implementation Overview      *      * This class and its nested classes provide the main      * functionality and control for a set of worker threads:      * Submissions from non-FJ threads enter into submission queues.      * Workers take these tasks and typically split them into subtasks      * that may be stolen by other workers.  Preference rules give      * first priority to processing tasks from their own queues (LIFO      * or FIFO, depending on mode), then to randomized FIFO steals of      * tasks in other queues.      *      * WorkQueues      * ==========      *      * Most operations occur within work-stealing queues (in nested      * class WorkQueue).  These are special forms of Deques that      * support only three of the four possible end-operations -- push,      * pop, and poll (aka steal), under the further constraints that      * push and pop are called only from the owning thread (or, as      * extended here, under a lock), while poll may be called from      * other threads.  (If you are unfamiliar with them, you probably      * want to read Herlihy and Shavit's book "The Art of      * Multiprocessor programming", chapter 16 describing these in      * more detail before proceeding.)  The main work-stealing queue      * design is roughly similar to those in the papers "Dynamic      * Circular Work-Stealing Deque" by Chase and Lev, SPAA 2005      * (http://research.sun.com/scalable/pubs/index.html) and      * "Idempotent work stealing" by Michael, Saraswat, and Vechev,      * PPoPP 2009 (http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1504186).      * The main differences ultimately stem from GC requirements that      * we null out taken slots as soon as we can, to maintain as small      * a footprint as possible even in programs generating huge      * numbers of tasks. To accomplish this, we shift the CAS      * arbitrating pop vs poll (steal) from being on the indices      * ("base" and "top") to the slots themselves.  So, both a      * successful pop and poll mainly entail a CAS of a slot from      * non-null to null.  Because we rely on CASes of references, we      * do not need tag bits on base or top.  They are simple ints as      * used in any circular array-based queue (see for example      * ArrayDeque).  Updates to the indices must still be ordered in a      * way that guarantees that top == base means the queue is empty,      * but otherwise may err on the side of possibly making the queue      * appear nonempty when a push, pop, or poll have not fully      * committed. Note that this means that the poll operation,      * considered individually, is not wait-free. One thief cannot      * successfully continue until another in-progress one (or, if      * previously empty, a push) completes.  However, in the      * aggregate, we ensure at least probabilistic non-blockingness.      * If an attempted steal fails, a thief always chooses a different      * random victim target to try next. So, in order for one thief to      * progress, it suffices for any in-progress poll or new push on      * any empty queue to complete. (This is why we normally use      * method pollAt and its variants that try once at the apparent      * base index, else consider alternative actions, rather than      * method poll.)      *      * This approach also enables support of a user mode in which local      * task processing is in FIFO, not LIFO order, simply by using      * poll rather than pop.  This can be useful in message-passing      * frameworks in which tasks are never joined.  However neither      * mode considers affinities, loads, cache localities, etc, so      * rarely provide the best possible performance on a given      * machine, but portably provide good throughput by averaging over      * these factors.  (Further, even if we did try to use such      * information, we do not usually have a basis for exploiting it.      * For example, some sets of tasks profit from cache affinities,      * but others are harmed by cache pollution effects.)      *      * WorkQueues are also used in a similar way for tasks submitted      * to the pool. We cannot mix these tasks in the same queues used      * for work-stealing (this would contaminate lifo/fifo      * processing). Instead, we randomly associate submission queues      * with submitting threads, using a form of hashing.  The      * ThreadLocal Submitter class contains a value initially used as      * a hash code for choosing existing queues, but may be randomly      * repositioned upon contention with other submitters.  In      * essence, submitters act like workers except that they are      * restricted to executing local tasks that they submitted (or in      * the case of CountedCompleters, others with the same root task).      * However, because most shared/external queue operations are more      * expensive than internal, and because, at steady state, external      * submitters will compete for CPU with workers, ForkJoinTask.join      * and related methods disable them from repeatedly helping to      * process tasks if all workers are active.  Insertion of tasks in      * shared mode requires a lock (mainly to protect in the case of      * resizing) but we use only a simple spinlock (using bits in      * field qlock), because submitters encountering a busy queue move      * on to try or create other queues -- they block only when      * creating and registering new queues.      *      * Management      * ==========      *      * The main throughput advantages of work-stealing stem from      * decentralized control -- workers mostly take tasks from      * themselves or each other. We cannot negate this in the      * implementation of other management responsibilities. The main      * tactic for avoiding bottlenecks is packing nearly all      * essentially atomic control state into two volatile variables      * that are by far most often read (not written) as status and      * consistency checks.      *      * Field "ctl" contains 64 bits holding all the information needed      * to atomically decide to add, inactivate, enqueue (on an event      * queue), dequeue, and/or re-activate workers.  To enable this      * packing, we restrict maximum parallelism to (1<<15)-1 (which is      * far in excess of normal operating range) to allow ids, counts,      * and their negations (used for thresholding) to fit into 16bit      * fields.      *      * Field "plock" is a form of sequence lock with a saturating      * shutdown bit (similarly for per-queue "qlocks"), mainly      * protecting updates to the workQueues array, as well as to      * enable shutdown.  When used as a lock, it is normally only very      * briefly held, so is nearly always available after at most a      * brief spin, but we use a monitor-based backup strategy to      * block when needed.      *      * Recording WorkQueues.  WorkQueues are recorded in the      * "workQueues" array that is created upon first use and expanded      * if necessary.  Updates to the array while recording new workers      * and unrecording terminated ones are protected from each other      * by a lock but the array is otherwise concurrently readable, and      * accessed directly.  To simplify index-based operations, the      * array size is always a power of two, and all readers must      * tolerate null slots. Worker queues are at odd indices. Shared      * (submission) queues are at even indices, up to a maximum of 64      * slots, to limit growth even if array needs to expand to add      * more workers. Grouping them together in this way simplifies and      * speeds up task scanning.      *      * All worker thread creation is on-demand, triggered by task      * submissions, replacement of terminated workers, and/or      * compensation for blocked workers. However, all other support      * code is set up to work with other policies.  To ensure that we      * do not hold on to worker references that would prevent GC, ALL      * accesses to workQueues are via indices into the workQueues      * array (which is one source of some of the messy code      * constructions here). In essence, the workQueues array serves as      * a weak reference mechanism. Thus for example the wait queue      * field of ctl stores indices, not references.  Access to the      * workQueues in associated methods (for example signalWork) must      * both index-check and null-check the IDs. All such accesses      * ignore bad IDs by returning out early from what they are doing,      * since this can only be associated with termination, in which      * case it is OK to give up.  All uses of the workQueues array      * also check that it is non-null (even if previously      * non-null). This allows nulling during termination, which is      * currently not necessary, but remains an option for      * resource-revocation-based shutdown schemes. It also helps      * reduce JIT issuance of uncommon-trap code, which tends to      * unnecessarily complicate control flow in some methods.      *      * Event Queuing. Unlike HPC work-stealing frameworks, we cannot      * let workers spin indefinitely scanning for tasks when none can      * be found immediately, and we cannot start/resume workers unless      * there appear to be tasks available.  On the other hand, we must      * quickly prod them into action when new tasks are submitted or      * generated. In many usages, ramp-up time to activate workers is      * the main limiting factor in overall performance (this is      * compounded at program start-up by JIT compilation and      * allocation). So we try to streamline this as much as possible.      * We park/unpark workers after placing in an event wait queue      * when they cannot find work. This "queue" is actually a simple      * Treiber stack, headed by the "id" field of ctl, plus a 15bit      * counter value (that reflects the number of times a worker has      * been inactivated) to avoid ABA effects (we need only as many      * version numbers as worker threads). Successors are held in      * field WorkQueue.nextWait.  Queuing deals with several intrinsic      * races, mainly that a task-producing thread can miss seeing (and      * signalling) another thread that gave up looking for work but      * has not yet entered the wait queue. We solve this by requiring      * a full sweep of all workers (via repeated calls to method      * scan()) both before and after a newly waiting worker is added      * to the wait queue. During a rescan, the worker might release      * some other queued worker rather than itself, which has the same      * net effect. Because enqueued workers may actually be rescanning      * rather than waiting, we set and clear the "parker" field of      * WorkQueues to reduce unnecessary calls to unpark.  (This      * requires a secondary recheck to avoid missed signals.)  Note      * the unusual conventions about Thread.interrupts surrounding      * parking and other blocking: Because interrupts are used solely      * to alert threads to check termination, which is checked anyway      * upon blocking, we clear status (using Thread.interrupted)      * before any call to park, so that park does not immediately      * return due to status being set via some other unrelated call to      * interrupt in user code.      *      * Signalling.  We create or wake up workers only when there      * appears to be at least one task they might be able to find and      * execute. However, many other threads may notice the same task      * and each signal to wake up a thread that might take it. So in      * general, pools will be over-signalled.  When a submission is      * added or another worker adds a task to a queue that has fewer      * than two tasks, they signal waiting workers (or trigger      * creation of new ones if fewer than the given parallelism level      * -- signalWork), and may leave a hint to the unparked worker to      * help signal others upon wakeup).  These primary signals are      * buttressed by others (see method helpSignal) whenever other      * threads scan for work or do not have a task to process.  On      * most platforms, signalling (unpark) overhead time is noticeably      * long, and the time between signalling a thread and it actually      * making progress can be very noticeably long, so it is worth      * offloading these delays from critical paths as much as      * possible.      *      * Trimming workers. To release resources after periods of lack of      * use, a worker starting to wait when the pool is quiescent will      * time out and terminate if the pool has remained quiescent for a      * given period -- a short period if there are more threads than      * parallelism, longer as the number of threads decreases. This      * will slowly propagate, eventually terminating all workers after      * periods of non-use.      *      * Shutdown and Termination. A call to shutdownNow atomically sets      * a plock bit and then (non-atomically) sets each worker's      * qlock status, cancels all unprocessed tasks, and wakes up      * all waiting workers.  Detecting whether termination should      * commence after a non-abrupt shutdown() call requires more work      * and bookkeeping. We need consensus about quiescence (i.e., that      * there is no more work). The active count provides a primary      * indication but non-abrupt shutdown still requires a rechecking      * scan for any workers that are inactive but not queued.      *      * Joining Tasks      * =============      *      * Any of several actions may be taken when one worker is waiting      * to join a task stolen (or always held) by another.  Because we      * are multiplexing many tasks on to a pool of workers, we can't      * just let them block (as in Thread.join).  We also cannot just      * reassign the joiner's run-time stack with another and replace      * it later, which would be a form of "continuation", that even if      * possible is not necessarily a good idea since we sometimes need      * both an unblocked task and its continuation to progress.      * Instead we combine two tactics:      *      *   Helping: Arranging for the joiner to execute some task that it      *      would be running if the steal had not occurred.      *      *   Compensating: Unless there are already enough live threads,      *      method tryCompensate() may create or re-activate a spare      *      thread to compensate for blocked joiners until they unblock.      *      * A third form (implemented in tryRemoveAndExec) amounts to      * helping a hypothetical compensator: If we can readily tell that      * a possible action of a compensator is to steal and execute the      * task being joined, the joining thread can do so directly,      * without the need for a compensation thread (although at the      * expense of larger run-time stacks, but the tradeoff is      * typically worthwhile).      *      * The ManagedBlocker extension API can't use helping so relies      * only on compensation in method awaitBlocker.      *      * The algorithm in tryHelpStealer entails a form of "linear"      * helping: Each worker records (in field currentSteal) the most      * recent task it stole from some other worker. Plus, it records      * (in field currentJoin) the task it is currently actively      * joining. Method tryHelpStealer uses these markers to try to      * find a worker to help (i.e., steal back a task from and execute      * it) that could hasten completion of the actively joined task.      * In essence, the joiner executes a task that would be on its own      * local deque had the to-be-joined task not been stolen. This may      * be seen as a conservative variant of the approach in Wagner&      * Calder "Leapfrogging: a portable technique for implementing      * efficient futures" SIGPLAN Notices, 1993      * (http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=155354). It differs in      * that: (1) We only maintain dependency links across workers upon      * steals, rather than use per-task bookkeeping.  This sometimes      * requires a linear scan of workQueues array to locate stealers,      * but often doesn't because stealers leave hints (that may become      * stale/wrong) of where to locate them.  It is only a hint      * because a worker might have had multiple steals and the hint      * records only one of them (usually the most current).  Hinting      * isolates cost to when it is needed, rather than adding to      * per-task overhead.  (2) It is "shallow", ignoring nesting and      * potentially cyclic mutual steals.  (3) It is intentionally      * racy: field currentJoin is updated only while actively joining,      * which means that we miss links in the chain during long-lived      * tasks, GC stalls etc (which is OK since blocking in such cases      * is usually a good idea).  (4) We bound the number of attempts      * to find work (see MAX_HELP) and fall back to suspending the      * worker and if necessary replacing it with another.      *      * Helping actions for CountedCompleters are much simpler: Method      * helpComplete can take and execute any task with the same root      * as the task being waited on. However, this still entails some      * traversal of completer chains, so is less efficient than using      * CountedCompleters without explicit joins.      *      * It is impossible to keep exactly the target parallelism number      * of threads running at any given time.  Determining the      * existence of conservatively safe helping targets, the      * availability of already-created spares, and the apparent need      * to create new spares are all racy, so we rely on multiple      * retries of each.  Compensation in the apparent absence of      * helping opportunities is challenging to control on JVMs, where      * GC and other activities can stall progress of tasks that in      * turn stall out many other dependent tasks, without us being      * able to determine whether they will ever require compensation.      * Even though work-stealing otherwise encounters little      * degradation in the presence of more threads than cores,      * aggressively adding new threads in such cases entails risk of      * unwanted positive feedback control loops in which more threads      * cause more dependent stalls (as well as delayed progress of      * unblocked threads to the point that we know they are available)      * leading to more situations requiring more threads, and so      * on. This aspect of control can be seen as an (analytically      * intractable) game with an opponent that may choose the worst      * (for us) active thread to stall at any time.  We take several      * precautions to bound losses (and thus bound gains), mainly in      * methods tryCompensate and awaitJoin.      *      * Common Pool      * ===========      *      * The static common Pool always exists after static      * initialization.  Since it (or any other created pool) need      * never be used, we minimize initial construction overhead and      * footprint to the setup of about a dozen fields, with no nested      * allocation. Most bootstrapping occurs within method      * fullExternalPush during the first submission to the pool.      *      * When external threads submit to the common pool, they can      * perform some subtask processing (see externalHelpJoin and      * related methods).  We do not need to record whether these      * submissions are to the common pool -- if not, externalHelpJoin      * returns quickly (at the most helping to signal some common pool      * workers). These submitters would otherwise be blocked waiting      * for completion, so the extra effort (with liberally sprinkled      * task status checks) in inapplicable cases amounts to an odd      * form of limited spin-wait before blocking in ForkJoinTask.join.      *      * Style notes      * ===========      *      * There is a lot of representation-level coupling among classes      * ForkJoinPool, ForkJoinWorkerThread, and ForkJoinTask.  The      * fields of WorkQueue maintain data structures managed by      * ForkJoinPool, so are directly accessed.  There is little point      * trying to reduce this, since any associated future changes in      * representations will need to be accompanied by algorithmic      * changes anyway. Several methods intrinsically sprawl because      * they must accumulate sets of consistent reads of volatiles held      * in local variables.  Methods signalWork() and scan() are the      * main bottlenecks, so are especially heavily      * micro-optimized/mangled.  There are lots of inline assignments      * (of form "while ((local = field) != 0)") which are usually the      * simplest way to ensure the required read orderings (which are      * sometimes critical). This leads to a "C"-like style of listing      * declarations of these locals at the heads of methods or blocks.      * There are several occurrences of the unusual "do {} while      * (!cas...)"  which is the simplest way to force an update of a      * CAS'ed variable. There are also other coding oddities (including      * several unnecessary-looking hoisted null checks) that help      * some methods perform reasonably even when interpreted (not      * compiled).      *      * The order of declarations in this file is:      * (1) Static utility functions      * (2) Nested (static) classes      * (3) Static fields      * (4) Fields, along with constants used when unpacking some of them      * (5) Internal control methods      * (6) Callbacks and other support for ForkJoinTask methods      * (7) Exported methods      * (8) Static block initializing statics in minimally dependent order      */

comment|/**      * Queues supporting work-stealing as well as external task      * submission. See above for main rationale and algorithms.      * Implementation relies heavily on "Unsafe" intrinsics      * and selective use of "volatile":      *      * Field "base" is the index (mod array.length) of the least valid      * queue slot, which is always the next position to steal (poll)      * from if nonempty. Reads and writes require volatile orderings      * but not CAS, because updates are only performed after slot      * CASes.      *      * Field "top" is the index (mod array.length) of the next queue      * slot to push to or pop from. It is written only by owner thread      * for push, or under lock for external/shared push, and accessed      * by other threads only after reading (volatile) base.  Both top      * and base are allowed to wrap around on overflow, but (top -      * base) (or more commonly -(base - top) to force volatile read of      * base before top) still estimates size. The lock ("qlock") is      * forced to -1 on termination, causing all further lock attempts      * to fail. (Note: we don't need CAS for termination state because      * upon pool shutdown, all shared-queues will stop being used      * anyway.)  Nearly all lock bodies are set up so that exceptions      * within lock bodies are "impossible" (modulo JVM errors that      * would cause failure anyway.)      *      * The array slots are read and written using the emulation of      * volatiles/atomics provided by Unsafe. Insertions must in      * general use putOrderedObject as a form of releasing store to      * ensure that all writes to the task object are ordered before      * its publication in the queue.  All removals entail a CAS to      * null.  The array is always a power of two. To ensure safety of      * Unsafe array operations, all accesses perform explicit null      * checks and implicit bounds checks via power-of-two masking.      *      * In addition to basic queuing support, this class contains      * fields described elsewhere to control execution. It turns out      * to work better memory-layout-wise to include them in this class      * rather than a separate class.      *      * Performance on most platforms is very sensitive to placement of      * instances of both WorkQueues and their arrays -- we absolutely      * do not want multiple WorkQueue instances or multiple queue      * arrays sharing cache lines. (It would be best for queue objects      * and their arrays to share, but there is nothing available to      * help arrange that).  Unfortunately, because they are recorded      * in a common array, WorkQueue instances are often moved to be      * adjacent by garbage collectors. To reduce impact, we use field      * padding that works OK on common platforms; this effectively      * trades off slightly slower average field access for the sake of      * avoiding really bad worst-case access. (Until better JVM      * support is in place, this padding is dependent on transient      * properties of JVM field layout rules.) We also take care in      * allocating, sizing and resizing the array. Non-shared queue      * arrays are initialized by workers before use. Others are      * allocated on first use.      */

The ec field is never accessed alone, but always      * together with id and st. The offsets of counts by the target      * parallelism and the positionings of fields makes it possible to      * perform the most common checks via sign tests of fields: When      * ac is negative, there are not enough active workers, when tc is      * negative, there are not enough total workers, and when e is      * negative, the pool is terminating.  To deal with these possibly      * negative fields, we use casts in and out of "short" and/or      * signed shifts to maintain signedness.      *      * When a thread is queued (inactivated), its eventCount field is      * set negative, which is the only way to tell if a worker is      * prevented from executing tasks, even though it must continue to      * scan for them to avoid queuing races. Note however that      * eventCount updates lag releases so usage requires care.      *      * Field plock is an int packed with:      * SHUTDOWN: true if shutdown is enabled (1 bit)      * SEQ:  a sequence lock, with PL_LOCK bit set if locked (30 bits)      * SIGNAL: set when threads may be waiting on the lock (1 bit)      *      * The sequence number enables simple consistency checks:      * Staleness of read-only operations on the workQueues array can      * be checked by comparing plock before vs after the reads.      */

This lock body      * must also be exception-free. Because the plock seq value can      * eventually wrap around zero, this method harmlessly fails to      * reinitialize if workQueues exists, while still advancing plock.      */

If the worker is not inactivated, it      * takes and returns a task from this queue. Otherwise, if not      * activated, it signals workers (that may include itself) and      * returns so caller can retry. Also returns for true if the      * worker array may have changed during an empty scan.  On failure      * to find a task, we take one of the following actions, after      * which the caller will retry calling this method unless      * terminated.      *      * * If pool is terminating, terminate the worker.      *      * * If not already enqueued, try to inactivate and enqueue the      * worker on wait queue. Or, if inactivating has caused the pool      * to be quiescent, relay to idleAwaitWork to possibly shrink      * pool.      *      * * If already enqueued and none of the above apply, possibly      * park awaiting signal, else lingering to help scan and signal.      *      * * If a non-empty queue discovered or left as a hint,      * help wake up other workers before return.      *      * @param w the worker (via its WorkQueue)      * @return a task or null if none found      */

comment|/**      * Returns a cheap heuristic guide for task partitioning when      * programmers, frameworks, tools, or languages have little or no      * idea about task granularity.  In essence by offering this      * method, we ask users only about tradeoffs in overhead vs      * expected throughput and its variance, rather than how finely to      * partition tasks.      *      * In a steady state strict (tree-structured) computation, each      * thread makes available for stealing enough tasks for other      * threads to remain active. Inductively, if all threads play by      * the same rules, each thread should make available only a      * constant number of tasks.      *      * The minimum useful constant is just 1. But using a value of 1      * would require immediate replenishment upon each steal to      * maintain enough tasks, which is infeasible.  Further,      * partitionings/granularities of offered tasks should minimize      * steal rates, which in general means that threads nearer the top      * of computation tree should generate more than those nearer the      * bottom. In perfect steady state, each thread is at      * approximately the same level of computation tree. However,      * producing extra tasks amortizes the uncertainty of progress and      * diffusion assumptions.      *      * So, users will want to use values larger (but not much larger)      * than 1 to both smooth over transient shortages and hedge      * against uneven progress; as traded off against the cost of      * extra task overhead. We leave the user to pick a threshold      * value to compare with the results of this call to guide      * decisions, but recommend values such as 3.      *      * When all threads are active, it is on average OK to estimate      * surplus strictly locally. In steady-state, if one thread is      * maintaining say 2 surplus tasks, then so are others. So we can      * just use estimated queue length.  However, this strategy alone      * leads to serious mis-estimates in some non-steady-state      * conditions (ramp-up, ramp-down, other stalls). We can detect      * many of these by further considering the number of "idle"      * threads, that are known to have zero queued tasks, so      * compensate by a factor of (#idle/#active) threads.      *      * Note: The approximation of #busy workers as #active workers is      * not very good under current signalling scheme, and should be      * improved.      */

comment|/**      * Interface for extending managed parallelism for tasks running      * in {@link ForkJoinPool}s.      *      *<p>A {@code ManagedBlocker} provides two methods.  Method      * {@code isReleasable} must return {@code true} if blocking is      * not necessary. Method {@code block} blocks the current thread      * if necessary (perhaps internally invoking {@code isReleasable}      * before actually blocking). These actions are performed by any      * thread invoking {@link ForkJoinPool#managedBlock}.  The      * unusual methods in this API accommodate synchronizers that may,      * but don't usually, block for long periods. Similarly, they      * allow more efficient internal handling of cases in which      * additional workers may be, but usually are not, needed to      * ensure sufficient parallelism.  Toward this end,      * implementations of method {@code isReleasable} must be amenable      * to repeated invocation.      *      *<p>For example, here is a ManagedBlocker based on a      * ReentrantLock:      *<pre> {@code      * class ManagedLocker implements ManagedBlocker {      *   final ReentrantLock lock;      *   boolean hasLock = false;      *   ManagedLocker(ReentrantLock lock) { this.lock = lock; }      *   public boolean block() {      *     if (!hasLock)      *       lock.lock();      *     return true;      *   }      *   public boolean isReleasable() {      *     return hasLock || (hasLock = lock.tryLock());      *   }      * }}</pre>      *      *<p>Here is a class that possibly blocks waiting for an      * item on a given queue:      *<pre> {@code      * class QueueTaker<E> implements ManagedBlocker {      *   final BlockingQueue<E> queue;      *   volatile E item = null;      *   QueueTaker(BlockingQueue<E> q) { this.queue = q; }      *   public boolean block() throws InterruptedException {      *     if (item == null)      *       item = queue.take();      *     return true;      *   }      *   public boolean isReleasable() {      *     return item != null || (item = queue.poll()) != null;      *   }      *   public E getItem() { // call after pool.managedBlock completes      *     return item;      *   }      * }}</pre>      */
