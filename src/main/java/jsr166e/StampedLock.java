The state of a StampedLock consists of a version and mode.  * Lock acquisition methods return a stamp that represents and  * controls access with respect to a lock state; "try" versions of  * these methods may instead return the special value zero to  * represent failure to acquire access. Lock release and conversion  * methods require stamps as arguments, and fail if they do not match  * the state of the lock. The three modes are:  *  *<ul>  *  *<li><b>Writing.</b> Method {@link #writeLock} possibly blocks  *   waiting for exclusive access, returning a stamp that can be used  *   in method {@link #unlockWrite} to release the lock. Untimed and  *   timed versions of {@code tryWriteLock} are also provided. When  *   the lock is held in write mode, no read locks may be obtained,  *   and all optimistic read validations will fail.</li>  *  *<li><b>Reading.</b> Method {@link #readLock} possibly blocks  *   waiting for non-exclusive access, returning a stamp that can be  *   used in method {@link #unlockRead} to release the lock. Untimed  *   and timed versions of {@code tryReadLock} are also provided.</li>  *  *<li><b>Optimistic Reading.</b> Method {@link #tryOptimisticRead}  *   returns a non-zero stamp only if the lock is not currently held  *   in write mode. Method {@link #validate} returns true if the lock  *   has not been acquired in write mode since obtaining a given  *   stamp.  This mode can be thought of as an extremely weak version  *   of a read-lock, that can be broken by a writer at any time.  The  *   use of optimistic mode for short read-only code segments often  *   reduces contention and improves throughput.  However, its use is  *   inherently fragile.  Optimistic read sections should only read  *   fields and hold them in local variables for later use after  *   validation. Fields read while in optimistic mode may be wildly  *   inconsistent, so usage applies only when you are familiar enough  *   with data representations to check consistency and/or repeatedly  *   invoke method {@code validate()}.  For example, such steps are  *   typically required when first reading an object or array  *   reference, and then accessing one of its fields, elements or  *   methods.</li>  *  *</ul>  *  *<p>This class also supports methods that conditionally provide  * conversions across the three modes. For example, method {@link  * #tryConvertToWriteLock} attempts to "upgrade" a mode, returning  * a valid write stamp if (1) already in writing mode (2) in reading  * mode and there are no other readers or (3) in optimistic mode and  * the lock is available. The forms of these methods are designed to  * help reduce some of the code bloat that otherwise occurs in  * retry-based designs.  *  *<p>StampedLocks are designed for use as internal utilities in the  * development of thread-safe components. Their use relies on  * knowledge of the internal properties of the data, objects, and  * methods they are protecting.  They are not reentrant, so locked  * bodies should not call other unknown methods that may try to  * re-acquire locks (although you may pass a stamp to other methods  * that can use or convert it).  The use of read lock modes relies on  * the associated code sections being side-effect-free.  Unvalidated  * optimistic read sections cannot call methods that are not known to  * tolerate potential inconsistencies.  Stamps use finite  * representations, and are not cryptographically secure (i.e., a  * valid stamp may be guessable). Stamp values may recycle after (no  * sooner than) one year of continuous operation. A stamp held without  * use or validation for longer than this period may fail to validate  * correctly.  StampedLocks are serializable, but always deserialize  * into initial unlocked state, so they are not useful for remote  * locking.  *  *<p>The scheduling policy of StampedLock does not consistently  * prefer readers over writers or vice versa.  All "try" methods are  * best-effort and do not necessarily conform to any scheduling or  * fairness policy. A zero return from any "try" method for acquiring  * or converting locks does not carry any information about the state  * of the lock; a subsequent invocation may succeed.  *  *<p>Because it supports coordinated usage across multiple lock  * modes, this class does not directly implement the {@link Lock} or  * {@link ReadWriteLock} interfaces. However, a StampedLock may be  * viewed {@link #asReadLock()}, {@link #asWriteLock()}, or {@link  * #asReadWriteLock()} in applications requiring only the associated  * set of functionality.  *  *<p><b>Sample Usage.</b> The following illustrates some usage idioms  * in a class that maintains simple two-dimensional points. The sample  * code illustrates some try/catch conventions even though they are  * not strictly needed here because no exceptions can occur in their  * bodies.<br>  *  *<pre>{@code  * class Point {  *   private double x, y;  *   private final StampedLock sl = new StampedLock();  *  *   void move(double deltaX, double deltaY) { // an exclusively locked method  *     long stamp = sl.writeLock();  *     try {  *       x += deltaX;  *       y += deltaY;  *     } finally {  *       sl.unlockWrite(stamp);  *     }  *   }  *  *   double distanceFromOriginV1() { // A read-only method  *     long stamp;  *     if ((stamp = sl.tryOptimisticRead()) != 0L) { // optimistic  *       double currentX = x;  *       double currentY = y;  *       if (sl.validate(stamp))  *         return Math.sqrt(currentX * currentX + currentY * currentY);  *     }  *     stamp = sl.readLock(); // fall back to read lock  *     try {  *       double currentX = x;  *       double currentY = y;  *         return Math.sqrt(currentX * currentX + currentY * currentY);  *     } finally {  *       sl.unlockRead(stamp);  *     }  *   }  *  *   double distanceFromOriginV2() { // combines code paths  *     double currentX = 0.0, currentY = 0.0;  *     for (long stamp = sl.tryOptimisticRead(); ; stamp = sl.readLock()) {  *       try {  *         currentX = x;  *         currentY = y;  *       } finally {  *         if (sl.tryConvertToOptimisticRead(stamp) != 0L) // unlock or validate  *           break;  *       }  *     }  *     return Math.sqrt(currentX * currentX + currentY * currentY);  *   }  *  *   void moveIfAtOrigin(double newX, double newY) { // upgrade  *     // Could instead start with optimistic, not read mode  *     long stamp = sl.readLock();  *     try {  *       while (x == 0.0&& y == 0.0) {  *         long ws = sl.tryConvertToWriteLock(stamp);  *         if (ws != 0L) {  *           stamp = ws;  *           x = newX;  *           y = newY;  *           break;  *         }  *         else {  *           sl.unlockRead(stamp);  *           stamp = sl.writeLock();  *         }  *       }  *     } finally {  *       sl.unlock(stamp);  *     }  *   }  * }}</pre>  *  * @since 1.8  * @author Doug Lea  */

comment|/*      * Algorithmic notes:      *      * The design employs elements of Sequence locks      * (as used in linux kernels; see Lameter's      * http://www.lameter.com/gelato2005.pdf      * and elsewhere; see      * Boehm's http://www.hpl.hp.com/techreports/2012/HPL-2012-68.html)      * and Ordered RW locks (see Shirako et al      * http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2312015)      *      * Conceptually, the primary state of the lock includes a sequence      * number that is odd when write-locked and even otherwise.      * However, this is offset by a reader count that is non-zero when      * read-locked.  The read count is ignored when validating      * "optimistic" seqlock-reader-style stamps.  Because we must use      * a small finite number of bits (currently 7) for readers, a      * supplementary reader overflow word is used when the number of      * readers exceeds the count field. We do this by treating the max      * reader count value (RBITS) as a spinlock protecting overflow      * updates.      *      * Waiters use a modified form of CLH lock used in      * AbstractQueuedSynchronizer (see its internal documentation for      * a fuller account), where each node is tagged (field mode) as      * either a reader or writer. Sets of waiting readers are grouped      * (linked) under a common node (field cowait) so act as a single      * node with respect to most CLH mechanics.  By virtue of the      * queue structure, wait nodes need not actually carry sequence      * numbers; we know each is greater than its predecessor.  This      * simplifies the scheduling policy to a mainly-FIFO scheme that      * incorporates elements of Phase-Fair locks (see Brandenburg&      * Anderson, especially http://www.cs.unc.edu/~bbb/diss/).  In      * particular, we use the phase-fair anti-barging rule: If an      * incoming reader arrives while read lock is held but there is a      * queued writer, this incoming reader is queued.  (This rule is      * responsible for some of the complexity of method acquireRead,      * but without it, the lock becomes highly unfair.)      *      * These rules apply to threads actually queued. All tryLock forms      * opportunistically try to acquire locks regardless of preference      * rules, and so may "barge" their way in.  Randomized spinning is      * used in the acquire methods to reduce (increasingly expensive)      * context switching while also avoiding sustained memory      * thrashing among many threads.  We limit spins to the head of      * queue. A thread spin-waits up to SPINS times (where each      * iteration decreases spin count with 50% probability) before      * blocking. If, upon wakening it fails to obtain lock, and is      * still (or becomes) the first waiting thread (which indicates      * that some other thread barged and obtained lock), it escalates      * spins (up to MAX_HEAD_SPINS) to reduce the likelihood of      * continually losing to barging threads.      *      * Nearly all of these mechanics are carried out in methods      * acquireWrite and acquireRead, that, as typical of such code,      * sprawl out because actions and retries rely on consistent sets      * of locally cached reads.      *      * As noted in Boehm's paper (above), sequence validation (mainly      * method validate()) requires stricter ordering rules than apply      * to normal volatile reads (of "state").  In the absence of (but      * continual hope for) explicit JVM support of intrinsics with      * double-sided reordering prohibition, or corresponding fence      * intrinsics, we for now uncomfortably rely on the fact that the      * Unsafe.getXVolatile intrinsic must have this property      * (syntactic volatile reads do not) for internal purposes anyway,      * even though it is not documented.      *      * The memory layout keeps lock state and queue pointers together      * (normally on the same cache line). This usually works well for      * read-mostly loads. In most other cases, the natural tendency of      * adaptive-spin CLH locks to reduce memory contention lessens      * motivation to further spread out contended locations, but might      * be subject to future improvements.      */

comment|/**      * If node non-null, forces cancel status and unsplices it from      * queue if possible and wakes up any cowaiters (of the node, or      * group, as applicable), and in any case helps release current      * first waiter if lock is free. (Calling with null arguments      * serves as a conditional form of release, which is not currently      * needed but may be needed under possible future cancellation      * policies). This is a variant of cancellation methods in      * AbstractQueuedSynchronizer (see its detailed explanation in AQS      * internal documentation).      *      * @param node if nonnull, the waiter      * @param group either node or the group node is cowaiting with      * @param interrupted if already interrupted      * @return INTERRUPTED if interrupted or Thread.interrupted, else zero      */
