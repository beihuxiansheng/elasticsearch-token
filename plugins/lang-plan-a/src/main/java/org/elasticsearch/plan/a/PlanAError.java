comment|/**  * The PlanAError class is used to throw internal errors caused by Plan A scripts that cannot be  * caught using a standard {@link Exception}.  This prevents the user from catching this specific error  * (as Exceptions are available in the Plan A API, but Errors are not,) and possibly continuing to do  * something hazardous.  The alternative was extending {@link Throwable}, but that seemed worse than using  * an {@link Error} in this case.  */
