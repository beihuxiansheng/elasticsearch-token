comment|/**  * Metadata is a wrapper for all the data that is collected by the {@link Analyzer}.  Each node in the ANTLR parse tree  * will have one of the types of metadata to store information used either in a different node by the analyzer  * or by the {@link Writer} during byte code generation.  Metadata also contains several objects passed into the  * {@link Analyzer} and {@link Writer} used during compilation including the {@link Definition}, the source code,  * the root of the ANTLR parse tree, and the {@link CompilerSettings}.  */
