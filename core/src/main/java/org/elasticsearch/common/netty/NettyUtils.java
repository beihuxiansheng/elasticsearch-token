comment|/**      * Here we go....      *<p>      * When using the socket or file channel API to write or read using heap ByteBuffer, the sun.nio      * package will convert it to a direct buffer before doing the actual operation. The direct buffer is      * cached on an array of buffers under the nio.ch.Util$BufferCache on a thread local.      *<p>      * In netty specifically, if we send a single ChannelBuffer that is bigger than      * SocketSendBufferPool#DEFAULT_PREALLOCATION_SIZE (64kb), it will just convert the ChannelBuffer      * to a ByteBuffer and send it. The problem is, that then same size DirectByteBuffer will be      * allocated (or reused) and kept around on a thread local in the sun.nio BufferCache. If very      * large buffer is sent, imagine a 10mb one, then a 10mb direct buffer will be allocated as an      * entry within the thread local buffers.      *<p>      * In ES, we try and page the buffers allocated, all serialized data uses {@link org.elasticsearch.common.bytes.PagedBytesReference}      * typically generated from {@link org.elasticsearch.common.io.stream.BytesStreamOutput}. When sending it over      * to netty, it creates a {@link org.jboss.netty.buffer.CompositeChannelBuffer} that wraps the relevant pages.      *<p>      * The idea with the usage of composite channel buffer is that a single large buffer will not be sent over      * to the sun.nio layer. But, this will only happen if the composite channel buffer is created with a gathering      * flag set to true. In such a case, the GatheringSendBuffer is used in netty, resulting in calling the sun.nio      * layer with a ByteBuffer array.      *<p>      * This, potentially would have been as disastrous if the sun.nio layer would have tried to still copy over      * all of it to a direct buffer. But, the write(ByteBuffer[]) API (see sun.nio.ch.IOUtil), goes one buffer      * at a time, and gets a temporary direct buffer from the BufferCache, up to a limit of IOUtil#IOV_MAX (which      * is 1024 on most OSes). This means that there will be a max of 1024 direct buffer per thread.      *<p>      * This is still less than optimal to be honest, since it means that if not all data was written successfully      * (1024 paged buffers), then the rest of the data will need to be copied over again to the direct buffer      * and re-transmitted, but its much better than trying to send the full large buffer over and over again.      *<p>      * In ES, we use by default, in our paged data structures, a page of 16kb, so this is not so terrible.      *<p>      * Note, on the read size of netty, it uses a single direct buffer that is defined in both the transport      * and http configuration (based on the direct memory available), and the upstream handlers (SizeHeaderFrameDecoder,      * or more specifically the FrameDecoder base class) makes sure to use a cumulation buffer and not copy it      * over all the time.      *<p>      * TODO: potentially, a more complete solution would be to write a netty channel handler that is the last      * in the pipeline, and if the buffer is composite, verifies that its a gathering one with reasonable      * sized pages, and if its a single one, makes sure that it gets sliced and wrapped in a composite      * buffer.      */
