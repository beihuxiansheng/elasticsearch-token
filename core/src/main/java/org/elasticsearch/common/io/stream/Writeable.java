comment|/**  * Implementers can be written to a {@linkplain StreamOutput} and read from a {@linkplain StreamInput}. This allows them to be "thrown  * across the wire" using Elasticsearch's internal protocol. If the implementer also implements equals and hashCode then a copy made by  * serializing and deserializing must be equal and have the same hashCode. It isn't required that such a copy be entirely unchanged. For  * example, {@link org.elasticsearch.common.unit.TimeValue} converts the time to nanoseconds for serialization.  * {@linkplain org.elasticsearch.common.unit.TimeValue} actually implements {@linkplain Streamable} not {@linkplain Writeable} but it has  * the same contract.  *  * Prefer implementing this interface over implementing {@link Streamable} where possible. Lots of code depends on {@linkplain Streamable}  * so this isn't always possible.  *  * The fact that this interface extends {@link StreamableReader} should be consider vestigial. Instead of using its  * {@link #readFrom(StreamInput)} method you should prefer using the Reader interface as a reference to a constructor that takes  * {@link StreamInput}. The reasoning behind this is that most "good" readFrom implementations just delegated to such a constructor anyway  * and they required an unsightly PROTOTYPE object.  */
