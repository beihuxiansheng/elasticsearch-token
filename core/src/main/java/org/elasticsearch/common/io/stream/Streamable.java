comment|/**  * Implementers can be written to a {@linkplain StreamOutput} and read from a {@linkplain StreamInput}. This allows them to be "thrown  * across the wire" using Elasticsearch's internal protocol. If the implementer also implements equals and hashCode then a copy made by  * serializing and deserializing must be equal and have the same hashCode. It isn't required that such a copy be entirely unchanged. For  * example, {@link org.elasticsearch.common.unit.TimeValue} converts the time to nanoseconds for serialization.  *  * Prefer implementing {@link Writeable} over implementing this interface where possible. Lots of code depends on this interface so this  * isn't always possible.  *  * Implementers of this interface almost always declare a no arg constructor that is exclusively used for creating "empty" objects on which  * you then call {@link #readFrom(StreamInput)}. Because {@linkplain #readFrom(StreamInput)} isn't part of the constructor the fields  * on implementers cannot be final. It is these reasons that this interface has fallen out of favor compared to {@linkplain Writeable}.  */
