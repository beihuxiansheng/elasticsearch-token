comment|/**  * Needs to be implemented by all {@link org.elasticsearch.action.ActionRequest} subclasses that are composed of multiple subrequests  * which relate to one or more indices. Allows to retrieve those subrequests and reason about them separately. A composite request is  * executed by its own transport action class (e.g. {@link org.elasticsearch.action.search.TransportMultiSearchAction}), which goes  * through all the subrequests and delegates their execution to the appropriate transport action (e.g.  * {@link org.elasticsearch.action.search.TransportSearchAction}) for each single item.  */
