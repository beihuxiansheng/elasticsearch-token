Methods invoked  * during bootstrap should explicitly declare the checked exceptions that they can throw, rather  * than declaring the top-level checked exception {@link Exception}. This exception exists to wrap  * these checked exceptions so that  * {@link Bootstrap#init(boolean, Path, boolean, org.elasticsearch.common.settings.Settings)}  * does not have to declare all of these checked exceptions.  */
